# TouchToneDecoder
Telephones use two tones at different frequencies to identify the number pressed on the key pad. This program takes in a sound clip and uses fast Fourier transform to identify the two individual frequencies in the composite signal. From there we can use the known standard to find the numbers that were pressed. Mr. Fourier knows what's up!!
